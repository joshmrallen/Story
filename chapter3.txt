The next day was Release Day: memorial for the day the quarantine was lifted and the residents were allowed to go about their lives as they did before the pandemic. It is memorialized for what happened after. The infection curve resurged and the toll on the population was several orders of magnitude greater than before. Thousands died per day, literally decimating the population of New York City. Release Day was memorialized to remember this for the next pandemic.
